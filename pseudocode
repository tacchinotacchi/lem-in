decision contains a snapshot, candidates for the next shortest path (basically a state of the MPS algo) and a list of subdecisions

explore_decision(decision):
	snapshot <- snapshot from decision
	candidates <- candidates from decision
	while there are subdecisions
		path <- get kth feasible path from snapshot and candidates
		if reached maximum decision depth
			curr_decisions[depth] <- {snapshot, path};
			if solution not obsolete
				report solution
				clean up obsolete subdecisions from curr_decisions
		else, for each subdecision solved by path
			if subdecision has not been cleaned up
				clean up if obsolete
			if subdecision has been cleaned up
				delete reference to subdecision
				continue;
			curr_decisions[depth] <- {snapshot, path}
			explore_decision(subdecision)
